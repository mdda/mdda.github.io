### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the twenty-eighth MeetUp - which was a TensorFlow World Extended event - ](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/266224621/),
was hosted by Google Singapore, and recapped the TensorFlow World event we attended in Silicon Valley at the end of October.  

<!--

Need to read : 
  Text to text transfer transformer from Google  (potential for Sam at next TF&DL)
    https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer
Potential topic :
  MelGAN 
    http://swpark.me/melgan/
  Neural Structured Learning (NSL): Training with Structured Signals
    https://www.tensorflow.org/neural_structured_learning
    Looks v. promising
    
    
Aurelien to talk "Intro to Apache Beam" and 
  might give a couple TensorFlow examples including TF Datasets and TF Transform
  == "Preprocessing large datasets with Apache Beam and TF Transform"

Sam talk on T5 + BART (maybe) or "Hey GPT2"



!-->

Sam's talk gave an overview of the latest research into TensorFlow models  : "T5 and ... ".

Aurelien Geron ... "Preprocessing large datasets with Apache Beam and TF Transform"

My talk was "Neural Structured Learning (NSL): Training with Structured Signals"
