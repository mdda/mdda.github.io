### Presentation Link

I was honoured to be chosen to give talk in the Machine Learning track at 
the  [Google DevFest](https://events.withgoogle.com/devfest-singapore-2019/) event in Singpore on 30-November-2019.

My talk, titled "Faces in the Browser using TensorFlow.js", went through 
the various 'levels' of code in TensorFlow.js, described the tasks involved in 
manipulating faces in the browser (using the attached webcam, or the phone's own camera in the case of mobile),
and also how these models are trained (broadly).  

The slides for my talk are here :
