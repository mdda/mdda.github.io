### Presentation Link

I was honoured to be chosen to give the last talk of the day for the Machine Learning track at 
the  [Google DevFest](https://events.withgoogle.com/devfest-singapore-2019/) event in Singpore on 30-November-2019.

My talk, titled "Faces in the Browser using TensorFlow.js", went through 
the various levels of code in TensorFlow.js; described the tasks involved in 
manipulating faces in the browser (using the attached webcam, or the phone's own camera in the case of mobile);
and also how these models are trained (broadly).  

To avoid the talk getting too theoretical, 
I put together a demo that everyone in the room could try for themselves : I even
had two helpers on stage to show how the embeddings (aka 'QR codes') for each of our faces
could be clustered so that the machine could recognise the individuals later.

Because the demo is in Javascript, executed entirely in the user's browser, 
you can examine the (trashy) code just by doing an 'inspect'.

The slides for my talk (which include a link to the operating demo) are here :
