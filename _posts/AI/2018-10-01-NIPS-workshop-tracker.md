    2. ML related projects : As the theme for this year is open ecosystems, projects of a more general nature such as software 
    infrastructure or tools for general data analysis are encouraged. This category is open for position papers, 
    interesting projects and ideas that may not be new software themselves, but link to machine learning and open source software.
    Submission format: abstract with no page limit. Please note that there will be no proceedings, i.e. the abstracts will not be published.
    We look forward for submissions that are novel, exciting and that appeal to the wider community.
