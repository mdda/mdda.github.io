### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I co-hosted a workshop session during the day-long 
SGInnovate New Frontier event in April 2021, which was hosted online.

My 45 minute talk was part of a dedicated AI track at the event "NEW FRONTIER : Build Your Deep Tech Career Today".  
The keynote address was given by Mr Lawrence Wong, Singapore's Minister for Education.  

The talk I gave dovetailed with Sam's, in that he talked about how front-end developers could get 
more "AI aware", and I looked at : 

*  The wide variety of jobs available in "AI"
*  How Regular Developers could pick up the skills to take advantage of these new opportunities

Importantly, Red Dragon AI (the company co-founded by me and Sam) has been partnering with SGInnovate since 2017 
to deliver public Deep learning courses, and our students receive funding through a government-approved process.
