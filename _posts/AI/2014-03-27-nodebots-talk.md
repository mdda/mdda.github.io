For the second meetup of the Singapore NodeBots group, 
I gave a rather broad talk explaining the movement towards 'coworking' robots - 
and how the confluence of a number of factors had made it into a 'real thing' now.

### Presentation Link

Unlike the later presentations, this one wasn't done with ```reveal.js``` : So here is the 
<strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2014-03-27_NodeBots-Presentation/" target="_blank">PDF version of my presentation</a></strong> 
to the [Singapore NodeBots MeetUp Group](http://www.meetup.com/NodeBotsSingapore/).
