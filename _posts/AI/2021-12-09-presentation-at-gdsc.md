### Presentation Link

In universities and colleges around the world, Google has encouraged the 
creation of "Google Developer Student Clubs".  To round out the year, 
Sam Witteveen and I decided to offer our three-part "Back-to-Basic" series 
to clubs in the South-East Asia region, to introduce them to TensorFlow and Deep Learning.

This session was the second in the three-part series, and focused 
on Deep Learning for computer vision using CNNs.  


Our presentation was in two parts:

*  My initial talk, that :
   +  Gave a brief outline of the use-cases for Deep Learning for vision tasks
   +  Introduced two new Layers : Conv2d and MaxPool2d
   +  Tantalised the group with 'Representation Learning ... Transfer Learning'
   
*  Sam did a Code-Along using Google Colab, where he lead the audience through :
   +  Loading and preparing a dataset beyond MNIST
   +  Building and Training a simple CNN model in Keras
   +  Doing some analysis of the model outputs
