### Presentation Link

At last the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/249595913/" target="_blank">Singapore AI Day</a></strong> arrived!  

Our speaker line-up included : 

*  A Recap from TensorFlow Summit - *Sorawit Saengkyongam, Google Developer Expert Machine Learning*

*  Machine Learning in JavaScript with TensorFlow.js - *Virot Chiraphadhanakul, Google Developer Expert Machine Learning*

*  Parallelising Machine Learing using R - *Chris Auld, Principal Technical Evangelist Manager - Southeast Asia at Microsoft*

*  Building AI Products: From Paper to Prototype to Production - *Sam Witteveen, Google Developer Expert Machine Learning*

*  Learn to Learn to Learn - *Martin Andrews, Google Developer Expert Machine Learning (me)*

*  Deep learning in life sciences - *Allen Day, Developer Advocate, Google*

*  Reinforcement Learning for Connect4 - *Hardeep Arora, Head AI/Advanced Analytics, Accenture* 

*  Data Science at GoJek



The talk I gave was an updated version of the FOSSASIA workshop I gave previously, but without
having people follow along with their own Virtual Machines, due to time construints.  

I chose to give greater weight to the last three of the four sections : 

*  Machine Learning in TensorFlow Playground 
*  Using Keras model zoo for the pre-trained NASNet model, and doing transfer learning there
*  Going through the Reptile meta-learning algorithm (implemented in PyTorch)
*  Showing how TensorFlow Eager mode can accomplish the same, line-by-line

As usual, all the source for the deeplearning-workshop notebooks 
is available on <a href="https://github.com/mdda/deep-learning-workshop" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - 
if you have questions on the software, please leave an 'issue' there.
