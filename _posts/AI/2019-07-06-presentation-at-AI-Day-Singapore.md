### Presentation Link

At last the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/249595913/" target="_blank">Singapore AI Day</a></strong> arrived!  

Our speaker line-up was : 

*  "Introduction to Keras in TensorFlow 2.0" - Paige Bailey, Google Brain

*  "Deep Learning on Graphs for Conversational AI" - Sam Witteveen, Red Dragon AI

*  "Which image should we show? Neural Linear Bandit for Image Selection" - Sirinart Tangruamsub, Agoda

*  "TFX" - Robert Crowe, Google Brain

*  "XLNet - The Latest in language models" - Martin Andrews, Red Dragon AI

*  "Swift for TensorFlow" - Paige Bailey, Google Brain

*  "TensorFlow Lite: On-Device ML and the Model Optimization Toolkit" - Jason Zaman, Light


The talk I gave was the 'cutting edge' one for the event, with the XLNet paper only having been published 10 days before the event...

Half my talk was introducing Transformer models generically,  
the next one third was about the innovations in XLNet, and the final third (yes, I overran a little)
was a 1-minute paper section with lots of cool stuff that people are doing with Transformers.
