### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I headed over to Cebu in the Phillipines in October,
to take part in the [tenth anniversary Cebu GDG DevFest event](https://devfest.gdgcebu.org/) - 
which was also advertised [on MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/GDGCebu/events/253369852/).

Sam and I presented at two different sessions : giving a 45-minute general-audience talk about
the TensorFlow ecosystem, and a (heavily oversubscribed) 3-hour Deep Learning workshop.
