When building a machine that thinks 'ideas', what does the first line of code look like?

Assembly of fragments.


Element of a story, for instance.

  Fundamental programming issues
  
    Frames and Schemes
    
    What does the class definition look like?
    
      Relationship to other ideas
      
      Flow of time
    
    Are there a certain list of idea 'types' - and are they global
    
      Noun
      
      Verb
      
      Location
      
      Texture
      
      Colour
      
      Shape
      
      ...
      
      Except that we're not really looking to just parse out sentences
      
        Sentences flow from a description activity on the Idea, not the actual idea
        
  
  Loose ends
  
    Can flesh out particular elements after introspection
    
      Before that, minds are happy to omit detail
  
  Distributed reasoning
  
    Interaction / conjunction of multiple ideas
    
    Flow of time
  
  Clues from short-term memory
  
    Only a small number of ideas can float around simultaneously in 'front of mind'
