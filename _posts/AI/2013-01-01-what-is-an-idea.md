When building a machine that thinks 'ideas', what does the first line of code look like?

* Assembly of fragments.
* Element of a story, for instance.

Outline:

* Fundamental programming issues
  + Frames and Schemes
  + What does the class definition look like?
    - Relationship to other ideas
    - Flow of time
  + Are there a certain list of idea 'types' - and are they global
    - Noun
    - Verb
    - Location
    - Texture
    - Colour
    - Shape
    - ...
    - Except that we're not really looking to just parse out sentences
      * Sentences flow from a description activity on the Idea, not the actual idea
  + Loose ends
    - Can flesh out particular elements after introspection
      * Before that, minds are happy to omit detail
  + Distributed reasoning
    - Interaction / conjunction of multiple ideas
    - Flow of time
  + Clues from short-term memory
    - Only a small number of ideas can float around simultaneously in 'front of mind'
