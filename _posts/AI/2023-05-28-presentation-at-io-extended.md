### Presentation Link

I was asked to give the Machine Learning keynote at the [Singapore Google I/O Extended 2023](https://sites.google.com/view/ioe23-sg/home)
event held in the Singapore Google Developer Space. 

The meetup was titled "MediaPipe with a bit of Bard", and included 4 different demos of MediaPipe functionality:

* Audio classification (showing the Google instant demo page)
* Facial landmarks (using the Javascript version via Codepen)
* Interactive Segmentation (using the Python notebook, migrated to Colab, and using Bard to fix the foreground/background mistake in Google's code)
* Text Classification (showing how TFLite could be used to ~minify MobileBERT, and Bard could be used to generate sample data)
