Sam Witteveen and I recently started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp,
and [the forth MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/239252636/) 
was again hosted by Google.

This 1 hour talk (which was intended to last 45 minutes) included a 
<a href="https://github.com/mdda/deep-learning-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/5-RNN/6-RNN-Tagger-keras.ipynb" target="_blank">TensorFlow version of the Upper Case NER notebook</a> that was already in the 
deep-learning-workshop repo - and I have to admit, the overall example is again better in the TF version,
because I teased out some details along the way, including adding a 
<a href="https://github.com/mdda/deep-learning-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/5-RNN/5-Text-Corpus-and-Embeddings.ipynb" target="_blank">full data downloader notebook</a> that enables the models to be used stand-alone.

The presentation also includes links to the relevant code at suitable points.

The presentation was kindly <a href="https://engineers.sg/video/rnn-and-text-tensorflow-and-deep-learning-singapore--1743" target="_blank">recorded by Engineers.sg</a>.


### Refactoring

By the way, the deep-learning-workshop repo is undergoing some major refactoring.  The aim is to 
make the individual examples work in a stand-alone fashion (downloading the necessary dependencies) while
the assembled-into-a-VM still works with everything pre-loaded. 

That means that downloading an individual notebook and stepping through it should *just work*.  If it doesn't 
please let me know, and I'll prioritorize fixing it.
