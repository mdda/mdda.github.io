### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the sixteenth MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning: Dialogue and NLP](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/251687521/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.



"The Rise of the Language Model" - Martin Andrews

This talk will explain a major current trend in Natural Language Processing : the 
increasing focus on using pre-built 'pure' language models (such as ELMO or the model 
recently announced by OpenAI), and then fine-tuning the output to suit your 
application. Martin will explain how this works, and you can create better models for your data, 
leveraging the models created on other, huge datasets by Google / OpenAI / Facebook / etc.
