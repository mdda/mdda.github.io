### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I have been running the TensorFlow and Deep Learning group in Singapore for over two years now, and 
we were once again invited to speak at the AI Day Thailand in Bangkok.

My talk was titled "Transformers and Unicorns", and outlined:
*  The principles of operation of Transformer-based models
*  The succession of Language Models (eg: GPT-2) and Fill-in-the-Blanks models (eg: BERT, up to ALBERT)
*  A bunch of 1-minute reviews of Transformer-related research

The slides for my talk are here :
