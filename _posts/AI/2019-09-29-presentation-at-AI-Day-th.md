### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I have been running the TensorFlow and Deep Learning group in Singapore for over two years now, and 
we were once again invited to speak at the AI Day Thailand in Bangkok.

My talk was titled "Transformers and Unicorns", 


and was intended to introduce the elements of a CNN model *before* explaining 
the intricacies of back-propagtion (i.e. in some ways it was a different approach 
from the typical "build from the ground up" NN introductory pitch).

The slides for my talk (as a 400Kb PDF) are here :
