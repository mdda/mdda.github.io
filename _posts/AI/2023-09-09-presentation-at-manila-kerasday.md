### Presentation Link

As part of the global effort to talk about Keras, I was invited to [GDG Manila](https://www.facebook.com/AIPilipinas) to talk about
the recently announced Keras Core:

*  What are the benefits of Keras Core being multi-backend?
*  What are the different backends good for?
*  How does this affect the overall Deep Learning framework ecosystem?

After the afternoon of talks, the speakers were invited to be part of a panel, where
we took questions from the audience - which was a lot of fun!

TODO : There's a [video of me doing the talk on YouTube](https://youtu.be/hVk7Py1c24Q) (this is a slightly longer version than the one at the MeetUp,
likely due to more asides, etc).  Please Like and Subscribe!

The slides for my talk, which contain links to all of the reference materials and sources, are here :
