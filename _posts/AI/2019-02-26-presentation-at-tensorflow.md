### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the twenty-second MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning - NeurIPS](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/259055570/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.





For my part, I gave a talk titled "Embed All The Things", which discussed how embeddings can be used in a wide variety of settings.  

Sam's talk showed the new TF tabular data interface for ```tf.data```, 
and did a demo using a cross-and-deep network for the Titanic dataset.
