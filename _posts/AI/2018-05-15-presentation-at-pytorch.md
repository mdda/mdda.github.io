Sam Witteveen and I started the PyTorch and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp back in August 2017.  Just
to prove that we intend to continue running this group, [the second MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/PyTorch-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/243672468/) 
was again hosted in Facebook's fine Singapore offices - and this time came complete with delicious food.

Following up from my discussion at the last event about the DeepMind paper 
["A simple neural network module for relational reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427).  I talked
about some work I've been doing (in PyTorch) that I have tentatively titled 
"Relationships from Entity Stream", the code for which is in [this github repo](https://github.com/mdda/relational-networks).
