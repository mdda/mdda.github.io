Sam Witteveen and I started the PyTorch and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp back in August 2017.  Since it
has been such a long time, we decided to 
have [our third MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/PyTorch-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/250567010/), once 
again hosted in Facebook's fine Singapore offices.  Despite it being in their cafeteria, 
there was (sadly) no food.

In addition to Sam Witteveen describing the new features of 0.4.0, and the roadmap to 1.0 for PyTorch,
we also had a Facebook employee that talked about his work with autonomously learning robots during 
his PhD days.

For my part, I gave an introductory talk about the Uber paper 
["Measuring the Intrinsic Dimension of Objective Landscapes"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08838).  In order to 
play around with the ideas myself, I rebuilt their models in PyTorch, 
and demonstrated that code in a Notebook via Colab 'hands-on'.
