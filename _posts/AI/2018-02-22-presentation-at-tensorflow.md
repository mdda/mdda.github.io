### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the eleventh MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning: NIPS review](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/247733545/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.

The line-up of talks included : 

*  My talk on 'Practice and Trends' (which was a condensed version of the first Tutorial session by Oriol Vinyals and Scott Reed);
*  Olzhas describing Capsule Networks using an extensive deck; 
*  Chaitanya (a researcher from EPFL, now at SAP via NTU) presenting "Personalization in Goal-Oriented Dialog", a paper which he co-wrote and was featured in the NIPS Conversational Agents Workshop; and 
*  Sam looking at the developments in the space of ML that creates other ML models (eg: AutoML).

I didn't present [the paper](/ai/2017/10/19/presentation-at-pytorch) that Sam and I had at the NIPS ViGiL workshop, 
since the code there was rather too PyTorch-y to show at Google offices...

Trend : Generative and Autoregressive Models (new speaker 39:00, slide68) 
  Latent variable models (VAE, DRAW)
  Implicit (GAN, GMME, Progressive GAN)
  Transform (NIDE, IAF, Real NVP)
  Autoregressive (NADE, MADE, RIDE, PixelCNN, WaveNet)
  
  First 3 covered in excellent UAI-2017 Tutorial
  GANs also covered in NIPS-2016 Tutorial

  slide70 : 40:25 : Autoregressive models : Main idea
  
  slide73 : 42:30 : Causal Convolution + Dilation + Stacks

                      Similar to training a teacher network (parallel) for fertilities
                      Then a student doesn't need to do attention

  slide108 : 57:31 : Scoring and sampling
                      Fully sequential : PixelCNN, WaveNet : O(1) scoring, O(N ) sampling
                      Conditional independence : O(1) scoring, better sampling
                      Distilled models : Parallel WaveNet, Parallel NMT : O(N) scoring, O(1) sampling
  
Trend : Domain Alignment (58:51, slide 111) un- or weakly- supervised
    This is a wiring game, rather than clever architectures
    i.e. Losses : Latent space (domain confusion), 
                  Pixel space (cycle consistency)
                  Adversarial and Liklihood losses work

     One-shot learning is in this category
  
  slide133 : 1:13:45 : Learning to Learn - sample new task => adapt quickly
  slide134 : 1:15:25 : Building the equation (SLIDE?)
  slide136 : 1:18:00 : Model-based; Metric-based; Optimisation-based
  slide137 : 1:21:00 : One-shot imitation learning
  
Trend : Graphs (1:22:00, slide 141)
  Natural trend :: Fixed->Tensor->Sequential->Graphs
    Building blocks : architecture game
    
  slide144 : 1:23:40 : Inductive bias for graphs : Want order-invariant model  (DeepSets = recommended)

Trend : Program induction (back to Scott : 1:30:00, slide165)
  Research landscape
    Neural network is the program
    Neural network generates the program source code (if it works : perfect generalisation)
    Probabalistic programming with neural networks (not now)
    
  slide168 : 1:32:20 : Learning to Execute "Bold" - apply seq2seq to everything
  slide170 : 1:33:20 : Neural Turing Machine / Differentiable Neural Computer (with memory)
  slide173 : 1:35:40 : Hierarchical Programs : Neural task programming
  slide175 : 1:36:25 : DeepCoder (generates code in a DSL) - use attribute prediction to prune search space
  slide176 : 1:38:15 : RobustFill (robust to data errors in I/O pairs)
  
Conclusions and Expectations (Scott : 1:41:07, slide181)
  Autoregressive models and ConvNets are already in use in consumer applications
  
  Inductive biases are useful
    - Spacial invariance : CNNs
    - Time recurrence : RNNs
    - Permutation invariance : Graphs
    
  More ResNet tricks to be discovered?
  
  GANs may have interesting market applications (phone apps)
