### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the Machine Learning Singapore Group (or MLSG for short) 
on MeetUp in February 2017 (it was previously named "TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore"),
and [the thirty-eighth MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/machine-learning-singapore/events/289808371/) 
was our first 'in-person' event since the COVID era.

As we anticipated, everyone was extremely glad to get back to seeing each other in person - it felt almost
surreal after being apart for so long : Lots of familiar faces to catch up with :-)

Many thanks are also due to the Google team, who not only allowed us to use Google's Developer Space, 
but were also kind enough to provide Pizza for the attendees, and also "Machine Learning Singapore"-branded
swag for the early arrivers!

This month's event is covering some of the recent advances in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs):

1. Instructive Prompting -  Sam Witteveen
     Prompting LLMs has opened up a whole new world in NLP. In this talk Sam will go through some of 
     the history of prompting in LLMs and how instructive prompting is being used in some of 
     the latest models such as FLAN and BloomZ to massively improve results and how you can use them in your own project.

2. Tomorrow's World - My talk
     Following on the current advances that Sam will talk about, this talk will highlight new research directions 
     that may point a way forwards (other than "just train bigger models for longer"). 
     This will include : 
        * Having models learn from human preference; 
        * create their own data; and 
        * create their own prompts.
