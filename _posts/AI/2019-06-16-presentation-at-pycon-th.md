### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I have been running the TensorFlow and Deep Learning group in Singapore for over two years now, and 
we were invited to speak at the PyCon Thailand in Bangkok.

My talk was titled "First steps in Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2.0 : CNNs", 
and was intended to introduce the elements of a CNN model *before* explaining 
the intricacies of back-propagtion (i.e. in some ways it was a different approach 
from the typical "build from the ground up" NN introductory pitch).

The slides for my talk (as a 400Kb PDF) are here :

PS: We also did a standing-room-only 2h40 workshop for developers at the conference on the Saturday - but
there are no slides for non-attendees...
