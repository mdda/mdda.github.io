### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the twenty-nineth MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/267156109/) 
was again hosted by Google Singapore.

<!--

Sam's talk was a quick round-up of several interesting TensorFlow-related projects at Google  : "Jax, Trax and stax of new stuff".

We were glad to have Rachel Lim visiting us from Google Brain and talking about "TF2.0 performance".

My talk was originally intended to be "Porting PyTorch Models to the TensorFlow ecosystem".  However,
in doing background research into the subject, I came 
across [a blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/converting-a-simple-deep-learning-model-from-pytorch-to-tensorflow-b6b353351f5d) 
written by Singaporean Yu Xuan Lee, and he generously agreed to give a talk about his work with ONNX at the MeetUp.

So, I "pivoted' : I had spent the previous weekend working on a TensorFlow Lite module, which 
would allow flexible and programmable graphing of metrics from TensorFlow (and PyTorch) modules within notebooks.

The slides for my talk are here :
