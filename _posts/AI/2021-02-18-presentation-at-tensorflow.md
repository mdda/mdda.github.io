### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the thirtieth MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/276147395/) 
was the first one that we've done online in the post-COVID new world.  It was hosted as a live YouTube event 
by Google's DevSpace Singapore using StreamYard, and was our contribution to the 
Google global initiative "TensorFlow Everywhere".  If you'd like to watch it, it's still available on
YouTube (use the link of the MeetUp page).

My talk addressed several new features in TensorFlow, including some of the Google Deep Learning research : 

*  `tf.experimental.numpy`
*  TensorFlow Profiler (including a quick demo)
*  Two research topics by the Google Brain team (using TensorFlow):
   +  TensorFlow Privacy (including Google's adversarial approach to whether data is being leaked)
   +  NeRF in the Wild (Neural Radiance Fields : i.e. create 3D visualisations from tourist photos)


The slides for my talk (as a 6Mb PDF) are here :
