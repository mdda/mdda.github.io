### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the twenty-second MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning : NeurIPS and the Cutting Edge](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/259055570/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.

At the Meetup, Sam talked about "Advances in Unsupervised and Self Supervised Learning", which
we felt was a particularly interesting trend at the conference.

We were also lucky enough to get Sumit Bam Shrestha, a researcher from NUS, to present on his NeurIPS paper : "SLAYER for Deep Spiking Neural Network".
Surprisingly, this was the first time we've discussed spiking neural networks (or really any truly biologically-inspired network) at our MeetUp.

For my part, I gave a talk titled "NeurIPS Lightning Talks", which discussed three topics (two from NeurIPS) in a "Lightning Talk" style.
