### Presentation Link

I was asked to give the Machine Learning keynote at the [Singapore Google I/O Extended 2022](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-singapore-presents-google-io-extended-singapore-2022/)
event held in the Singapore Google Developer Space.  While the event was held (finally) in-person,
it was also recorded - and this post is just to point to the video and slide deck.


The meetup was titled "NeurIPS and the State of Deep Learning", and was in two parts:

I discussed 3 key topics that came up during the main I/O event:

* Coral Micro Dev board
* Language / Vision Models at Google (including LaMDA and Imagen)
* JAX/Flax : A New ML Stack



The [video from the event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj9q6DVU8_M) is located in the [Google Developer Space YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiwz4_tbGyDYE64TuKe5-0g).
