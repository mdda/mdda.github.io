### Presentation Link

I recently lead a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2017-03-18_FOSSASIA-Workshop/" target="_blank">1 hour workshop</a></strong> 
at [FOSSASIA 2017](http://2017.fossasia.org/) in Singapore.

Similarly to the previous year, this workshop was hands-on : After a brief background on deep learning, 
participants started quickly, getting an understanding of features (and feature creation) 
by a 'blame assignment' algorithm (aka Backprop).  

For this FOSSASIA workshop, I also created a 
<a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2017-03-20_TFandDL_IntroToCNNs/CNN-demo.html" target="_blank">stand-alone CNN filter demo</a>, 
so that people could get an intuitive understanding of what a single 3x3 CNN filter can do.

Then, using the VirtualBox VM-on-a-stick, we had a quick look at a working GoogLeNet model.  And then went
on to a longer segment on how the CNN mechanism can be applied to Speech Recognition - 
a new application/module I put together specifically for FOSSASIA (in the preceeding 5 days, from concept
to working &amp; demonstrable code).

Naturally, this being a FOSS event, all the source is available 
on <a href="https://github.com/mdda/deep-learning-workshop" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - 
if you have questions on the software, please leave an 'issue' there.
