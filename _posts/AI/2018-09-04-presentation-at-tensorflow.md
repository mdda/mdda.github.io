### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the eighteenth MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning: Explainability and Interpretability](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/254044538/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.


To some extent the theme of the MeetUp was set by Lee XA volunteering to talk about 
"", based on his extensive experience as the TensorFlow 
maintainer for the Gentoo project.  Sam Witteveen (via video hook-up from New York) talked about 
the new Deep Learning VM images that Google released less than 2 weeks ago.  We also had
a lightning talk by Hardeep Arora about doing face detection in the browser using TensorFlow.js.







For my part, 
I gave a talk titled "Go Faster with float16", which explained some of the intricacies in 
training a model in a mixed-precision environment, such as might be used on a P100 or V100
GPU (if you want to use the float16 cores - or even the TensorCores - provided by these
server-class Nvidia chips).

The slides for my talk are here :
