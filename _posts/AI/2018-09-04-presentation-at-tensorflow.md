### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the eighteenth MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning: Explainability and Interpretability](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/254044538/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.


To some extent the theme of the MeetUp was set by Lee XA volunteering to talk about 
"Explainable AI : Shapley Values and Concept Activation Vectors", based on his experiences with 
Shapley values from Scott M. Lundberg NIPS 2016 paper titled "A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions" on a transfer learned model of a CNN.

We also had a talk by Hardeep Arora about XYZ.



For my part, 
I gave a talk titled "Does the Model Understand the Question?", which explained some of the 
thinking in the paper by the same title by [Mudrakarta <i>et al</i>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05492).
