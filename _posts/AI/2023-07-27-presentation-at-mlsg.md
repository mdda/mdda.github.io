### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the Machine Learning Singapore Group (or MLSG for short) 
on MeetUp in February 2017 (it was previously named "TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore"),
and [the forty-fifth MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/machine-learning-singapore/events/294778442/) 
was our nineth 'in-person' event since the COVID era.

My talk covered "Open-Endedness and Large Language Models":
 
* The research behind LLMs used in Agent systems
  + Fine-tuning; Self-Critique; Tool-Use; Memory; Planning
* What is Open-Endedness:
  + Some concepts and intuitions
  + Examples : Curriculum Learning; Reinforcement Learning; Meta-Learning; Evolution
  + and Applications

Sam talked about the design and implementation of agent systems, and gave demonstrations of sample use-cases.

Many thanks to the Google team, who not only allowed us to use Google's Developer Space, 
and put out the extra chairs required for our larger-than-expected attendence,
but were also kind enough to provide Pizza for the attendees!
