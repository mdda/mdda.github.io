### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the twentieth MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning: Happy Birthday TensorFlow](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/256431012/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.

We were honoured to have two Google Brain team members speak at the event : 

*  Rachel Lim talking about tf.data ("Beyond the Basics"); and
*  Chuan Yu Foo talking about TFX ("Complete ML Pipelines")

For my part, I gave a talk titled "Language Learning with BERT", which discussed the basics of Google's newly released BERT 
natural language processing model.
