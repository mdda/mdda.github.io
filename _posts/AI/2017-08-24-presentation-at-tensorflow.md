Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the seventh MeetUp, aka 'Mobile'](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/242085559/),
was again hosted by Google.

Since I don't claim to have specific mobile app development expertise, my 30 minute talk 
instead covered some of the theoretical ideas behind CNNs and the approaches being taken 
to fit 'large models' onto small devices (i.e. phones).

The presentation also includes links to the relevant code at suitable points.
