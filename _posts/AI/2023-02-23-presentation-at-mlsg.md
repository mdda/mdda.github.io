### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the Machine Learning Singapore Group (or MLSG for short) 
on MeetUp in February 2017 (it was previously named "TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore"),
and [the fortieth MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/machine-learning-singapore/events/291476564/) 
was our third 'in-person' event since the COVID era.

For this event we decided to go for a MeetUp about 'practical' and 'hands on' topics - which 
is why our speaker line-up focussed on PyTorch Lightning, techniques for using an training large models,
and the super-new `langchain` framework.  As far as we know, this was Asia's first/largest `langchain` meetups to-date.

Many thanks to the Google team, who not only allowed us to use Google's Developer Space, 
and put out the extra chairs required for our larger-than-expected attendence,
but were also kind enough to provide Pizza for the attendees!

This month's event was on the topic "LLMs + Frameworks (ToolFormer, Langchain,  & Lightning)", and included three talks:

1. News You Can Use - Martin Andrews :
  + So many papers, so little time! Martin will pick out a selection of interesting new directions being talked about - 
    with an emphasis on those that can be most immediately useful (i.e. not just reserved for large teams at huge scale).


2.  PyTorch Lightning - Vivek Kalyan :
  + By imposing a little bit of structure, PyTorch Lightning can provide a solid foundation around 
    the model-building process. Vivek will explain how this works in practice, and how it can simplify your workflow.

3.  Langchain - Building apps with LLMs - Sam Witteveen
  + Actually building real world apps with Large Language models can be a challenge on many fronts. Recently 
    the open source frameworks Langchain and GPT Index have come along to make this much easier 
    and add a variety of tools as addons for LLM apps.
