### Presentation Link

Following the trip that Sam Witteveen and I made to [Google IO](https://events.google.com/io/recap/) 
in Mountain View (Silicon Valley, California),  we held a Google-news themed TensorFlow event - 
appararently [our fifteenth MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/250679043/), 
and the first one since the group grew beyond 2,500 people...

In addition to my talk on TensorFlow.js, Sam talked about TPUs (and gave a live demo of this amazing technology), and
Dmitry Martyanov gave an interesting talk about sequence modelling (specifically where the time intervals between
the events in the sequence are also variable).

The slides for my talk about TensorFlow.js are here :
