Sam Witteveen and I were invited to speak at the main Singapore Data-Science meetup ("DSSG") 
for their July 2023 special on `langchain`.

My talk covered several topics under the broad heading of "Self-Improvement" (for Language Models):
 
* Improving Answers:
  + Self-Debug / Self-Refine
  + Constitutional AI
* Improving the System:
  + VOYAGER (GPT-4 planning for Minecraft)
* Creating training data:
  + `phi-1`
  + Evol-Instruct
