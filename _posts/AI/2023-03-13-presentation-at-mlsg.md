### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the Machine Learning Singapore Group (or MLSG for short) 
on MeetUp in February 2017 (it was previously named "TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore"),
and [the forty-first MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/machine-learning-singapore/events/291996393/) 
was our fourth 'in-person' event since the COVID era.

For this event, we started with two in-depth talks about Cloud computing, the first of which being 
Thu Ya Kyaw from Google talking about Vertex AI.  This was followed by 
Rodrigo Agundez from `adidas` who gave a high-level talk about the ideal workflow 
and infrastructure that's needed to provide a solid foundation for an enterprise team doing end-to-end ML.

After my own talk (about Minecraft, the NeurIPS BASALT competition, and several recent advances),
Sam talked about ControlNet and other recent advances in generative image AI.

Many thanks to the Google team, who not only allowed us to use Google's Developer Space, 
and put out the extra chairs required for our larger-than-expected attendence,
but were also kind enough to provide Pizza for the attendees!
