### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I co-hosted a workshop session during the day-long 
SGInnovate New Frontier event in September 2020, which was hosted online.


My 45 minute talk was part of a dedicated AI track at the event "NEW FRONTIER : DEEP TECH OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBS".  
The keynote address was given by Mr S Iswaran, Singapore's Minister for Communications and 
Information.  

Importantly, Red Dragon AI (the company co-founded by me and Sam) has been partnering with SGInnovate since 2017 
to deliver public Deep learning courses, and our students receive funding through a government-approved process.


My talk outlined some of the key areas addressed by "AI", but also : 

*  The wide variety of jobs available in "AI"; and that 
*  'Regular developers' could pick up the skills to take advantage of these new opportunities


The slides for my talk (as a 824Kb PDF) are here :
