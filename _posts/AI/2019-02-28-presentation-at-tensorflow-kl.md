### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I have been running the TensorFlow and Deep Learning group in Singapore for the past two years, and 
we were invited to speak at the KL (Malaysia) version remotely (Google Hangouts, using screen-sharing for the slides, etc).

For the Meetup, Sam talked about "Advances in Unsupervised and Self Supervised Learning", which
is the topic that he spoke about at our [latest Singapore TF&amp;DL MeetUp](/ai/2019/02/26/presentation-at-tensorflow).

For my part, I gave a talk titled "The Rise of the Language Models", which 
expanded on my [summer 2018 talk](/ai/2018/06/21/presentation-at-tensorflow) with the addition of BERT and the new GPT2 model from OpenAI.

The slides for my talk are here :
