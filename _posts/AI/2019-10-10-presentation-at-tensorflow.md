### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the twenty-fifth MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning : AutoML](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/261638882/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.  

My talk was titled "Single Path NAS and the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis", 
and was intended to introduce a few pieces of research - starting with the 
Single Path NAS paper, and touching on the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis work
(winner of best paper at ICLR 2019, and follow-on work by Uber).

Timothy Liu talked about the Keras AutoML module; 
Sam talked about hyperparameter search algorithms; 
and Olzhas described the RL methods behind OpenAI's recente DOTA success.
