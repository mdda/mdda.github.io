### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the twenty first MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning - Dealing with tabular data](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/257155233/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.


For my part, I gave a talk titled "Embed All The Things", which discussed how embeddings can be used in a wide variety of settings.  

Sam's talk showed the new TF tabular data interface for tf.data, and did a demo using a cross-and-deep network for the Titanic dataset.

"Embed All The Things" - Martin Andrews

In this talk for people just starting out, 
Martin will describe how Embeddings (inspired by their initial usecase in text) 
can be used to understand graph networks, image search and ... language itself.


Outline:

  Word Embeddings
  
  Other Sequence Embeddings
  
  Other Object Embeddings
  
  Multi-Object Embeddings
  
    
  ?Code etc
