### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the thirty-second MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/279168713/) 
was the second in a three-part series aimed at getting total beginners up to speed, 
so that we can resume our regular MeetUp series.  

Our presentation was in two parts:

*  My initial talk, that :
   +  Gave a brief outline of the use-cases for Deep Learning for vision tasks
   +  Introduced two new Layers : Conv2d and MaxPool2d
   +  Tantalised the group with 'Representation Learning ... Transfer Learning'
   
*  Sam did a Code-Along using Google Colab, where he lead the audience through :
   +  Loading and preparing a dataset beyond MNIST
   +  Building and Training a simple CNN model in Keras
   +  Doing some analysis of the model outputs
