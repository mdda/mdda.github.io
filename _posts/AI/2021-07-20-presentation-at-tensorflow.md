### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the thirty-third MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/279485016/) 
was the last in a three-part series aimed at getting total beginners up to speed, 
so that we can resume our regular MeetUp series.  

Our presentation was in two parts:

*  My initial talk, that :
   +  Gave a brief outline of the use-cases for Transformers for NLP tasks
   +  Introduced two new Layers : Tokenisation and Transformer
   +  Outlined the BERT task, and how we could then apply Transfer Learning
   
*  Sam did a Code-Along using Google Colab, where he lead the audience through :
   +  Loading and preparing an App review dataset
   +  Building a TensorFlow (Hugging Face) BERT Classifier
   +  Fine-tuning the model on our dataset, and looking at the outputs
