### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the twenty-fourth MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning : Beginners](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/259442585/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.  

My talk was titled "First steps in Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2.0 : CNNs".
