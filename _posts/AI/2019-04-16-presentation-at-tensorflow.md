### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the twenty-fourth MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning : Beginners](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/259442585/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.  

My talk was titled "First steps in Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2.0 : CNNs".

2019-04-16_TFandDL_TF2-CNNs

If we're going straight to CNNs, then perhaps :
show a CNN model in TF2
  explain the CNN kernel
  explain the MLP over flat
  explain the softmax
explain the hierarchy of blame
explain blame requires derivatives over generic parameterised models
fit the model to Regular MNIST
fit the same model to Cancer MNIST (?)
