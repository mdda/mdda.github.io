### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the thirty-first MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/279160231/) 
was the first in a three-part series aimed at getting total beginners up to speed, 
so that we can resume our regular MeetUp series.  

Our presentation was in two parts:

*  My initial talk, that :
   +  Gave a brief overview of what is meant by "AI" as marketing term
   +  Outlined the differences between Programming vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
      - with hand-waving
   +  Illustrated what an MLP can learn using TensorFlow Playground
   
*  Sam did a Code-Along using Google Colab, where he lead the audience through :
   +  Basic usage of Colab
   +  Tensor shapes
   +  Loading and preparing data
   +  Building and Training a simple MLP model in Keras
