We were honoured to have our paper about community building accepted bu the ["Machine Learning Open Source Software 2018: Sustainable communities"](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/Schedule?showEvent=10920)
workshop at NeurIPS (aka NIPS) 2018.  Moreover, since we've also be pencilled in for a speaking slot...
