Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and have been actively building the community around TensorFlow in the South-East Asia region ever since,

We were honoured to have our paper about community building accepted 
by the ["Machine Learning Open Source Software 2018: Sustainable communities"](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/Schedule?showEvent=10920)
workshop at NeurIPS (aka NIPS) 2018.  Moreover, we were also be given a 15 minute speaking slot...
