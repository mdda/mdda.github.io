### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp back in February 2017, 
and the group has grown significantly over the last ~12 months.  However, that also means that
many of the people who have recently joined missed out on our early sessions.  So we're re-running
some of the earlier events as <strike>"Replay"</strike> "Back-to-Basics" events, 
hoping that new people will be able to 'catch up' and get more out of coming to the main graoup events.  

Our [second 'Back-to-Basics' Meeting](https://www.sginnovate.com/events/deep-learning-and-tensorflow-back-basics-cnns) 
was supported by SGInnovate, in their office on Carpenter St.

As in the original March talk last year, I presented an introduction to CNNs, 
which are typically presented as a vision solution, using MNIST as an example.  
However, my version has a bit of a twist : Instead of using visual digits,
I have created a spoken-word dataset (the digits 0 to 9, of course), and the
CNN is trained to recognise spectrograms of the audio - i.e. the CNN is doing voice recognition!

The source for the CNN 'Stamps' Speech Recognition model is available on

you have questions on the software, please leave an 'issue' there.
