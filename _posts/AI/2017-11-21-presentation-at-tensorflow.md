### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp back in February 2017, and the 
group has grown significantly over the last ~9 months.  However, that also means that
many of the people who have recently joined missed out on our early sessions.  So we're re-running
some of the earlier events as "Replay" events, hoping that new people will be able to 'catch up'
and get more out of coming to the main graoup events.  

Our [first 'replay' MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/244988340/) 
was suppoerted by SGInnovate, in their office on Carpenter St.

As in the original February talk, we had one Intro talk and one that was slightly more involved.  Since Sam
already had the intro talk (complete with additional shiny slides created by the Google team) ready-to-roll, 
I simpled polished up my 'ecommerce' CNN example from the deep-learning-workshop (see below)
to work with TensorFlow, and presented that for about ~40 mins including questions. 

The source for the Transfer Learning model is available on 
<a href="https://github.com/mdda/deep-learning-workshop" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - if 
you have questions on the software, please leave an 'issue' there.
