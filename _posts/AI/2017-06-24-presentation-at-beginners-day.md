Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and we held a special [Deep Learning Beginners' Day event](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/240635858/) 
at the Level3 offices so that people could get up to speed for the regular monthly talks.

We shared the instruction over the course of the Saturday event - 
I lead off both morning and afternoon sessions with introductory material, as well as defining terms, 
with a strong dose of Mathematics in the morning to make sure everyone was awake...

Sam put together a set of nice Keras notebooks, running under Anaconda, so that people could try out some
examples for themselves.  This included some 'challenges' where people had to change network layouts, etc, 
to explore how to make things work better.
