### Presentation Link

In universities and colleges around the world, Google has encouraged the 
creation of "Google Developer Student Clubs".  To round out the year, 
Sam Witteveen and I decided to offer our three-part "Back-to-Basic" series 
to clubs in the South-East Asia region, to introduce them to TensorFlow and Deep Learning.

This session was the first in the three-part series, and focused 
on some basic ideas of Machine Learning, and introduced Deep Learning via MLPs.  

Our presentation was in two parts:

*  My initial talk, that :
   +  Gave a brief overview of what is meant by "AI" as marketing term
   +  Outlined the differences between Programming vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
      - with hand-waving
   +  Illustrated what an MLP can learn using TensorFlow Playground
   
*  Sam did a Code-Along using Google Colab, where he lead the audience through :
   +  Basic usage of Colab
   +  Tensor shapes
   +  Loading and preparing data
   +  Building and Training a simple MLP model in Keras
