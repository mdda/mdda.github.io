### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the Machine Learning Singapore Group (or MLSG for short) 
on MeetUp in February 2017 (it was previously named "TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore"),
and [the forty-third MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/machine-learning-singapore/events/293568384/) 
was our sixth 'in-person' event since the COVID era.

For this event, we planned on having more in-depth talks on LLM techniques, but
were also lucky enough to be able to host a speaker from a previous event : Rachel Lim!

After my own talk, which covered recent techniques that are showing promise in the prompt-engineering / fine-tuning area of LLMs,
Sam talked about more advanced usecases of `langchain`, along with demonstration Colabs.

Finally, instead of giving a formal talk, which might require many approvals from her current employer (Open AI),
we invited Rachel to talk about her experience as a Singaporean moving into the Silicon Valley tech world,
first via Stanford, then to Google, and most recently at Open AI.

Many thanks to the Google team, who not only allowed us to use Google's Developer Space, 
and put out the extra chairs required for our larger-than-expected attendence,
but were also kind enough to provide Pizza for the attendees!
