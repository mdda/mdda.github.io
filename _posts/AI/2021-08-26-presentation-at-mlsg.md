### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the thirty-fourth MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Singapore/events/279310825/) 
was the first under its new name "Machine Learning Singapore" (or MLSG for short).  

Our presentation "Back to the cutting edge - How Transformers are being applied everywhere" was in two parts:

*  "Transformers : Beyond NLP & Language Models" - Sam :
   +  How the Transformer architecture has made it's way out of just being used for text to 
      -  Computer Vision tasks
      -  Geometric deep learning 
      -  ... and more

*  "PerceiverIO &amp; PonderNet - DeepMind hype or the future?" - Martin :
   +  The newest iteration of the Perceiver architecture
      - how it can be applied to a whole variety of different inputs and outputs
   +  And DeepMind's "PonderNet" that can think for longer "like a human does"...
