### Presentation Link

I was recently to Thailand by Google to give a  <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2018-04-21_AI-Day-Thailand/" target="_blank">
50 minute talk</a></strong> at the Thai Google Developer Group's [2018 AI Day](http://redcatlabs.com/2018-04-21_AI-Day-Thailand/).

The talk I gave was an updated version of the FOSSASIA workshop I gave previously, but without
the ability for people to follow along with their own Virtual Machines.  Also, because the 
audience mix was a little different, I chose to spend approximately equal time on four sections : 

*  Machine Learning in TensorFlow Playground
*  Using Keras model zoo for the pre-trained NASNet model, and doing transfer learning there
*  Going through the Reptile meta-learning algorithm (implemented in PyTorch)
*  Showing how TensorFlow Eager mode can accomplish the same, line-by-line

As usual, all the source for the deeplearning-workshop notebooks 
is available on <a href="https://github.com/mdda/deep-learning-workshop" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - 
if you have questions on the software, please leave an 'issue' there.
