### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the twenty-ninth MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/268287536/) 
was hosted by Google Singapore, and was a theory-heavy recap of highlights from the NeurIPS conference held at the end of December.  

<!--

My talk addressed several hot topics in current Deep Learning research : 

*  "Deep Learning" vs "Good Old-Fashioned AI" : as represented by "The Debate" between Gary Marcus and Yoshua Bengio
*  Some major areas addressed in Yoshua Bengio's Keynote presentation at the conference :
   +  Attention, Representations and Symbols
   +  Causality
   +  Consciousness Prior and Losses
*  A quick overview of "The Book of Why" by Judea Pearl, including the three stages of causal reasoning
