Idea : Make a crossword solving helper for Mum

Need to be able to costrain answers by :

*  number of letters
*  specific known letters (frequently not set-in-stone)
*  'straight' meaning of clue
*  Names of people, places, etc : Facts

Further idea : Cryptic solver

*  https://crypticshewrote.wordpress.com/explanations/
*  Much more difficult reasoning problem...
