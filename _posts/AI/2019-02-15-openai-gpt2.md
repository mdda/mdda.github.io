### Initial Thoughts

*  Are the results too-good-to-be-true?
   -   Looking at the progression of GPT to BERT to NxBERT 
   -   Blog-posted output is admittedly cherry-picked (according to paper)
   -   PR-oriented outreach via blog, research content not so up-beat
   -   Research report also includes : 
       +   Trivia knowledge over-sold (since only top-30, whereas accuracy is &lt;1% overall)
       +   Main curiosity is about raw performance (eg: summarization via TL;DR)
       +   ...
   
   
*  Does it matter whether results are real?
   -   Is there value in announcing these results (for a debate)?
   -   Is this the purpose of the announcement?
   -   Actual results may be irrelevant?
   -   Watching the debate is v. informative in itself
   -   Notably, researchers from OpenAI are leaving the questions to their Ethics people



*  Why did Elon Musk leave?  And why no fan-fare?
   -   Actually had too much work to do at Tesla
   -   Got more interested in meme wars than future of humanity, etc  /s
   -   'Fake news' experiment might do credibility damage
   -   Actually worried about speed of development
   -   Wanted to use results in his own projects + denied
   -   Culmination of factors, including previous poaching of people
   

<!--
Trivia knowledge show tip-of-iceberg nature of what's being learned.

Per the [Week 8 (part c) CS294-158 Deep Unsupervised Learning (4/3/19) -- Ilya Sutskever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-B3nAN7YRM) lecture,
some certain number of parameters are required to learn the language 
(sentiment neuron only appears once the base language stuff is taken care of).
And the LMs have a lot of 'noise' that they find very 'attractive' - compared to the much less dense 'high level stuff'.

Basis of new idea : 
Perhaps the higher level stuff should be pulled from a DB rather than memorised within the network weights
(I have a plan...)
... but TransformerXL isn't going to give me decent sent2vec, unfortunately
      so have a look at random methods for sent2vec : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10444.pdf

  *  "NO TRAINING REQUIRED: EXPLORING RANDOM ENCODERS FOR SENTENCE CLASSIFICATION" : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10444.pdf
  *  Hierarchical Question Answeringy : ./2_Google_HierarchicalSearchWithBERT_1809.10658.pdf
TODO :  
  *  Add diagram of information flow (would be useful for poster too)
  *  Finish creating USE embeddings to see value of supervised pretraining too
  *  Experiment with different 'list of facts' schemes - to see whether it can be honed
     - eg: One sentence (/10) at a time, pick the highest confidence answer
        +  Still need answer probability
        +  Maybe scale it by 1/(len()^alpha)) to do comparisons
        +  However, in our case, shorter is probably better (needs testing...)
  *  Write a beam-searcher - would be much more efficient than plain 'best of 100' current version

     - Interesting : https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/
     - Twitter epic with pointers to updated ideas about Beam Search etc :
         +  https://twitter.com/thom_wolf/status/1124263846674345985
            = Beam bias fix : Correcting Length Bias in Neural Machine Translation 
               ~  https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10006
               ~  p3 : Add 0.6*n_bpes (32k byte-pair encoding) as correction factor to sum(log_prob)...
            = Nucleus Samplingh : The Curious Case of Neural Text Degeneration
               -  https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09751 
               -  "Figure 1: Beam search leads to degenerate text, even when generated from GPT-2-117M, ..."
               -  "Maxims of Communication (Grice, 1975) have established that people optimize against stating the obvious, making highly predictable text unlikely to occur in practice."

            = Code : https://gist.github.com/thomwolf/1a5a29f6962089e871b94cbd09daf317
         +  Perhaps 'most popular' wasn't such a bad idea
         
         +  Either way, should incorporate early stopping (again)
  *  Eliminate answers that simply repeat the question 
     - Need to return list of answers, so that second (or third, etc)-best can fill in
