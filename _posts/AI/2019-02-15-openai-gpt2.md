### Initial Thoughts


*  Are the results too-good-to-be-true?
   -   Looking at the progression of GPT to BERT to NxBERT 
   -   Blog-posted output is admittedly cherry-picked (according to paper)
   -   PR-oriented outreach via blog, research content not so up-beat
   -   Research report also includes : 
       +   Trivia knowledge over-sold (since only top-30, whereas accuracy is &lt;1% overall)
       +   Main curiosity is about raw performance (eg: summarization via TL;DR)
       +   ...
   
   
*  Does it matter whether results are real?
   -   Is there value in announcing these results (for a debate)?
   -   Is this the purpose of the announcement?
   -   Actual results may be irrelevant?
   -   Watching the debate is v. informative in itself
   -   Notably, researchers from OpenAI are leaving the questions to their Ethics people



*  Why did Elon Musk leave?  And why no fan-fare?
   -   Actually had too much work to do at Tesla
   -   Got more interested in meme wars than future of humanity, etc  /s
   -   'Fake news' experiment might do credibility damage
   -   Actually worried about speed of development
   -   Wanted to use results in his own projects + denied
   -   Culmination of factors, including previous poaching of people
