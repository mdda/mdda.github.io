TextGraphs-2019
  https://sites.google.com/view/textgraphs2019
  
  The workshops in the TextGraphs series have published and promoted the synergy between the field of Graph Theory and Natural Language Processing. 
  Besides traditional NLP applications like word sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling, 
  and information extraction graph-based solutions nowadays also target new web-scale applications like information propagation in social networks, 
  rumor proliferation, e-reputation, language dynamics learning, and future events prediction, to name a few.
  
  The (lucky!) thirteen edition of the TextGraphs workshop aims to extend the focus on 
  (1) issues and solutions for large-scale graphs, such as those derived for web-scale knowledge acquisition or social networks and 
  (2) graph-based and graph-supported machine learning and deep learning methods. 
  
  We encourage the description of novel NLP problems or applications that have emerged in recent years, 
  which can be addressed with existing and new graph-based methods. 
  Furthermore, we also encourage research on applications of graph-based methods in the area of Semantic Web 
  in order to link them to related NLP problems and applications.

  All submission deadlines are at 11:59 p.m. PST
  Paper submission: August 19, 2019
  Notification of acceptance: September 16, 2019
  Camera-ready submission: September 30, 2019
  Workshop date: November 3 or 4, 2019

  TextGraphs-13 solicits both long and short paper submissions:
    a short paper has up to 4 pages of content plus unlimited references;

MRQA: Machine Reading for Question Answering
  https://mrqa.github.io/
  Task is essentially over
  
  We seek submissions on the following topics:
    Accuracy: How can we make MRQA systems more accurate?
    Interpretability: How can systems provide rationales for their predictions? To what extent can cues such as attention over the document be helpful, compared to direct explanations? Can models generate derivations that justify their predictions?
    Speed and Scalability: Can models scale to consider multiple, lengthy documents, or the entire web as information source? Similarly, can they scale to consider richer answer spaces, such as sets of spans or entities instead of a single answer one?
    Robustness: How can systems generalize to other datasets and settings beyond the training distribution? Can we guarantee good performance on certain types of questions or documents?
    Dataset Creation: What are effective methods for building new MRQA datasets?
    Dataset Analysis: What challenges do current MRQA datasets pose?
    Error Analysis: What types of questions or documents are particularly challenging for existing systems?

  All submission deadlines are 11:59 PM GMT -12 (anywhere in the world).
  August 19, 2019: Deadline for submission
  September 16, 2019: Notification of acceptance

Neural Generation and Translation (WNGT 2019)
  https://sites.google.com/view/wngt19/home
  
  Neural sequence to sequence models are now a workhorse behind a wide variety of different natural language processing tasks 
  such as machine translation, generation, summarization and simplification. 
  This workshop aims to provide a forum for research in applications of neural models to language generation and translation tasks 
  (including machine translation, summarization, NLG from structured data, dialog response generation, among others).

  Efficiency shared task:   (NMT)
    https://sites.google.com/view/wngt19/efficiency-task
    Last year the task attracted 4 teams and we expect the number to be equal to or greater than this next year. 
    
  Document level generation and translation task: 
    https://sites.google.com/view/wngt19/dgt-task

  The workshop is broad in scope and invites original research contributions on all topics where neural networks 
  are involved in the field of machine translation. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:

    Neural models for machine translation, generation, summarization, simplification
    Analysis of the problems and opportunities of neural models for all of these tasks
    Methods for incorporating linguistic insights: syntax, alignment, reordering, etc.
    Handling resource-limited domains
    Utilizing more data: monolingual, multilingual resources
    Multi-task learning
    Neural translation and generation models for mobile devices
    Visualization of sequence-to-sequence models
    Beyond sentence-level processing
    Beyond maximum-likelihood estimation

  First call for papers: April 8, 2019
  Second call for papers: Jun 14, 2019
  Submission deadline: August 19, 2019
  Notification of acceptance: September 16, 2019 (+4w after submission)
  Camera-ready papers due: September 30, 2019 (+2w after notification)
  
  Extended Abstracts
  Preliminary ideas or results may also be submitted as extended abstracts, with a length of 2 to 4 pages plus references. 
  Similarly to full papers, these abstracts will follow the ACL formatting requirements, be submitted through Softconf, 
  and be reviewed by the program committee. 
  Accepted abstracts will be presented as posters, but not be included in the workshop proceedings. 
  Abstracts in this track should be anonymized, and should put "This is a submission to the extended abstract track." 
  at the end of the abstract submitted to Softconf (it does not need to be noted in the paper itself).
