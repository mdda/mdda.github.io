### Presentation Link



My talk was titled "First steps in Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2.0 : CNNs", 
and was intended to introduce the elements of a CNN model *before* explaining 
the intricacies of back-propagtion (i.e. in some ways it was a different approach 
from the typical "build from the ground up" NN introductory pitch).




The slides for my talk (as a 6Mb PDF) are here :
