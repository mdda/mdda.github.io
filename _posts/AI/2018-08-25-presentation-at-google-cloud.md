### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the sixteenth MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning: Dialogue and NLP](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/251687521/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.

In addition to Matt Henderson talking about "Machine Learning for Spoken Dialogue Systems", 
we had Hardeep Arora explaining "Sequence to Sequence Model Advances", as well as a last minute addition :
Bo Lin Ng giving a lightning talk about the fun he is having "Using TensorFlow to implement a Generative Adversarial Network".

For my part, 
I gave a talk on "The Rise of the Language Model", which set out to explain a major current 
trend in Natural Language Processing : the increasing focus on using 
pre-built 'pure' language models (such as ELMo or the model recently announced by OpenAI), 
and then fine-tuning the output to suit specific applications.
