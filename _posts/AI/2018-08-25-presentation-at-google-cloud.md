### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the sixteenth MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning: Dialogue and NLP](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/251687521/),
was again hosted by Google Singapore.

For my part, 
I gave a talk on "ML options from hardcore (TF) to autopilot (AutoML)", 
which gave a (super quick) run through of the ML spectrum available through Google : 
from DIY TensorFlow/Keras models to the shiny new AutoML tools.
