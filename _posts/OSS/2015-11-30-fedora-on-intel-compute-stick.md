I recently won an [Intel Compute Stick](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/compute-stick/intel-compute-stick.html) 
(Windows version) at the [Singapore FinTech 'Compliance' Hackathon](http://e27.co/event/fintechathon/)
(aka the Fintechathon).  The Windows version has 2Gb of RAM, and 32Gb of ~SSD 
(compared that to the version with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit installed, which only comes with 1Gb and 8Gb respectively - go figure).

```
~ssd = emmc
```

Of course, booting into Windows was not an option.  
However, my distribution preference is Fedora 
(rather than Ubuntu, which obviously has received more attention from Intel, since it's the officially supported version).

Installing Fedora on the device turned into (yet another) weekend of frustration and small gains...


> There's now a [new version of the Intel Compute stick](http://linuxgizmos.com/latest-intel-compute-sticks-use-skylake-and-cherry-trail-cpus/) out, 
> which may render working on this one moot (except for the fact that I hate to see computer hardware going to waste).  Certainly, 
> things are going to get more difficult to find on the web.


### Getting WiFi going

The chipset Intel is using is the [RTL8723BS](http://www.anandtech.com/show/9167/intel-compute-stick-review), 
which provides WiFi and Bluetooth as a bundle, over ```SDIO```,  which is a bit of an odd combination.

With the Fedora 23 live image installed (destructively, so there's no going back) 
onto the Compute Stick's ~SSD, there are kernel modules already there.  So as root, one can :

{% highlight bash %}
find /lib/modules/`uname -r`/ | grep 8723

mkdir compute-stick
[andrewsm@square tools]$ cd compute-stick/
[andrewsm@square compute-stick]$ git clone https://github.com/hadess/rtl8723bs

cd rtl8723bs
make

[root@tv rtl8723bs]# make install
install -p -m 644 r8723bs.ko  /lib/modules/4.2.6-301.fc23.x86_64/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/

Note on HD Audio Bitstreaming

As of April 2015, the Intel graphics drivers for Bay Trail-T (32-bit) have support 
only for bitstreaming of DTS, Dolby Digital and Dolby Digital Plus. 
This means that Netflix and other similar OTT sites are in the clear. 
However, users hoping to take advantage of lossless HD audio in Blu-ray backups are going to be disappointed. 
In any case, streaming of Blu-rays over a 802.11n Wi-Fi network will result in a bad user experience. 
So, it is possible that the absence of HD audio bitstreaming will not bother too many consumers.

 
### ```linuxium-dsdt-patch.sh```

https://www.happyassassin.net/fedlet-a-fedora-remix-for-bay-trail-tablets/

Changes :

*   ```dnf --assumeyes install acpica-tools```  # About 1Mb download

Need ```update-grub2``` : No, it is ```grub2-mkconfig``` in Fedora

```bash
##ln -sf /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg /etc/grub2-efi.cfg
##grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg

grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```

And change `\${libdir}/grub/grub-mkconfig_lib` to ??  `/usr/share/grub` instead of `/usr/lib/grub`

is the solution.

`/etc/grub2.cfg` &rarr; `../boot/grub2/grub.cfg`

is a bad link.





### ```linuxium-dsdt-patch.sh``` Updated for Fedora

... but DSDT patch doesn't seem to be necessary with 64-bit Fedora (need to check this).

```

I've got the patch working on the meegopad. 
It seems that the ACPI device HAD0F28 was marked as not ready. 
Its readiness is controlled by a flag (OSSL) in the DSDT, 
so I just forced it ready by returning a status of 0x0F 
and getting grub to provide a custom DSDT. 
Once I did this the audio came to life.

+Ian MORRISON after running the DSDT fix, investigating dmesg I see:

    :: points out that kernel may be quite new
    After cross checking the missing label / function / file etc in lxr website, the code confirmed have been changed from 3.16 --> 3.18 in large extend.  
    The i915 folder from the DKMS source package can be replaced with the Linux kernel source one (/drivers/gpu/drm/i915), almost all errors gone.
    The only error left is the missing reference from hdmi_audio_if.h which was actually backported from intel gma source code from kernel 2.6.x.
    I think the effort to port kernel 2.6.x source code to 3.18 is overwhelming.  So better stay at 3.16.

    Can you try the bytcr_rt5640 machine driver as the byt-rt5640 machine
    driver will be getting deprecated (since it only works with a small
    number of FWs). The bytcr_rt5640 driver works with a wider range of FW.

      When testing the bytcr_rt5640 machine driver give also a try to the latest firmwares:
      https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/vkoul/firmware.git/tree/intel?h=byt
      I had some success with fw_sst_0f28_ssp0.bin

    snd-soc-sst-bytcr-rt5640 will be loaded automatically if you use snd-intel-sst-acpi instead of snd-soc-sst-acpi, 
    you can blacklist the latter using a file in /etc/modprobe.d (look up the details), 
    or just remove snd-soc-sst-acpi.ko from the installation dir as a dirty hack.

    Note that different drivers expect different firmwares, you cannot mix them:
      snd-soc-sst-acpi   -> fw_sst_0f28.bin-48kHz_i2s_master
      snd-intel-sst-acpi -> fw_sst_0f28.bin
      snd-intel-sst-acpi -> fw_sst_0f28_ssp0.bin (renamed to fw_sst_0f28.bin)

      Very thorough writing from a user (or two) with Vinod@intel
      
        This is dpcm enabled driver.  So please route the FE to BE and it should work...

        Nicolas, this can be done by using the commands from here:
        http://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2015-June/094080.html

        In particular:
        amixer -c0 sset 'codec_out0 mix 0 pcm0_in' on
        amixer -c0 sset 'media0_out mix 0 media1_in' on

        $ cat /proc/interrupts | grep sst    
        7:          0          0          0          0   IO-APIC 28-fasteoi   intel_sst_driver
      
        Sorry I should have been clearer. The dynamic debug allows you to enbale debug logs without recompiling

        So after boot:
        echo -n 'module snd_soc_sst_mfld_platform +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

        this will enable prints, so when you start audio, the firmware would be
        downloaded, and please grab the dmesg ouput and send...

        A final note, you also need to set the right codec controls to get audio; 
        setting the FE-BE path is necessary to make playback "work" but it may not be enough to actually get sound, 
        so make sure you run the full script Vinod provided in :
        http://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2015-June/094080.html

        http://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2015-July/094663.html
          Ah, sorry, the info from that bug report is outdated, for the snd-intel-sst-acpi you have to change
            sound/soc/intel/atom/sst/sst_acpi.c:
```            
            
        
Restarting sound system after update:
Update from prior message: I fixed sound, using Pulseaudio. 
I had to "apt-get install pavucontrol", and then issue "alsa -force-reload". 
But now, sound works with vmlinuz-3.19.0-22-generic. Thanks everyone!

    In the issues (pkendall64 commented on May 1) : 
      I've built a kernel (3.16.7-ckt9) including your patch and installed the kernel onto a meegopad t01 bay trail-t CR device and rebooted.
      It boots fine and I get a message in the kernel boot logs (dmesg)
      ******* HAD DRIVER loading.. Ver: 0.01.003
      But I do not get any devices listed when I use aplay -l.
      Is there anything I can do to help diagnose the problem?

      I've got the patch working on the meegopad. 
      It seems that the ACPI device HAD0F28 was marked as not ready. 
      Its readiness is controlled by a flag (OSSL) in the DSDT, 
      so I just forced it ready by returning a status of 0x0F and getting grub to provide a custom DSDT. 
      Once I did this the audio came to life.

      Do you know if there's a proper way of controlling the OSSL flag?

Bluetooth comment :
  http://sparkylinux.org/forum/index.php?topic=3269.0
    Solved for external usb dongle using blueman instead of the shipped available bluetooth-mate that does not work, so removed bluetooth-mate completely then installed blueman with synaptic.
    
    mate-bluetooth has been dropped in favor of blueman, but there is no stable release available atm. 
    You should replace it with another bluetooth client, like xcfe4-bluetooth for example.
