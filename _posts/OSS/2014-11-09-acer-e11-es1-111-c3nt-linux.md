This is a nice little notebook I picked up recently at a Singapore Expo (NB: Prices in Singapore aren't nearly as cheap as the location would suggest : I should have stayed in the USA to get better prices...)

### Basic Specs

  * Intel Celeron CPU N2840 @ 2.16GHz
  * 2Gb RAM
  * 11inch display
  * 320Gb HD
  * Fanless
  
The last feature was actually somewhat attractive, since it speaks to good heat dissapation, which is an important factor in Singapore (where the heat/humidity seems to destroy electronics at an alarming rate).


### Aim : Never boot Windows, and install Linux

Getting into the BIOS initially : 

  *  Power switch 
  *  First display of "Acer" logo
  *  Mash F2 repeatedly
  
  
### BIOS parameter updates required

  * BIOS-Boot
  
    * Boot:Boot-Bode = <S>UEFI</S> Legacy
    * Boot:Boot-Priority-Order = 1. USB HDD : Generic Flash Disk (use F6 to move it, as prompted)
    * Main:F12-Boot-Menu = Enabled (Display F12 on boot up)
  

### Booting into Fedora Live (USB stick)

Fedora installer should then boot with USB stick in one of the back slots.

However, Fedora Linux didn't boot simply : 

  *  Needed to go into Troubleshooter and chose "Boot in simple display mode"

Then installation was as standard : 
  *  Rebooting into Linux brings up non-graphical boot screen (with the blue text-bar along the bottom of the screen.  
    *  Something must be off with the initial mode-setting.

  * Opted to liberate space in the Windows DATA partition (over 140Gb available there)
  
  
### First few boots

Just make sure one can cycle the machine reliably.

Then update while connected to hard-wire eth0 : 

{% highlight bash %}
yum install yum-plugins-fastestmirror
yum update yum 
# next line is optional :
yum remove transmission* claws-mail* midori* pidgin* remmina* liferea* abiword* orage* parole*
yum update
{% endhighlight %}

And some more 'personal taste' items : 

{% highlight bash %}
yum install firefox libreoffice vlc
yum install scite joe
yum install gimp inkscape
{% endhighlight %}

And power cycle again...


### Update the kernel parameters

Either test the new parameters by editing the kernel bootline at boot time, or make the changes 'permanent' (i.e. survive reboots and upgrades) by editing the ```/etc/default/grub``` file :

{% highlight bash %}
joe /etc/default/grub 
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
{% endhighlight %}

Things to add : 

  * ```i8042.nopnp```   
    *  seems to enable touchpad 
  * ```acpi_osi="Linux"```
    *  this is helpful with suspend (maybe)
    *  the ```"``` need to be quoted properly in the grub config file

Quoting-wise the end of the line in the ```/etc/default/grub``` file should read : ``` i8042.nopnp acpi_osi=\"Linux\""``` (where the last ```"``` closes the opening double-quote near the start of the long ```GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="``` definition.

Things to remove : 

  * ```nomodeset```
    *  this makes both the Disk-encryption box, and lightdm look much better
    *  And (suddenly) the brightness stuff seemed to work !!
    
Final, overall command line (seen near the start of ```dmesg | more```):

{% highlight bash %}
BOOT_IMAGE=/vmlinuz-3.16.7-200.fc20.x86_64 root=/dev/mapper/fedora-root ro rd.lvm.lv=fedora/swap vconsole.font=latarcyrheb-sun16 rd.lvm.lv=fedora/root rd.luks.uuid=luks-XXXX rhgb quiet acpi_osi=Linux
{% endhighlight %}

### Installing WiFi 

Once the latest kernel is installed, follow [these excellent instructions](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/fedora-linux-install-broadcom-wl-sta-wireless-driver-for-bcm43228/), which essentially require :

{% highlight bash %}
# wget and install rpmfusion-nonfree
yum installkmod-wl
{% endhighlight %}

This works!!
     
     
### Touchpad issues 

  *  If the touchpad has 'gone away' again : Try the ```Fn-F7``` is 'touchpad on/off' key
  
  *  Sometimes the touchpad goes 'berzerk', this can sometimes be cured (best method so far) by doing ```Fn-F7``` twice.
  
    * If anyone has any clues about how to fix this properly, then please leave a comment below

*NOTES:*

From the discussion below, it seems that the 'berzerk' thing may well not be Linux-related at all.  There
are quite a few complaints from Windows users too in the Acer forums, with many returning their
laptops to Acer for a hardware fix.  I didn't notice this initially, since my web searches were
always "Linux Acer touchpad ...", which effectively filtered out the overarching hardware aspect.



### Skype notes

There's no 64-bit version of Skype available, so one has to resort to the i686 (32-bit) verison.

Installing the Skype repo, and then the rpm will attempt to pull in a whole heap of 32-bit rpms too.

So, as a precheck, list out the {i586,i686} rpms already installed, so that if you want to remove Skype later (or Microsoft decides to offer an actual 64-bit version), one can get rid of all the dependencies in one move.

Fortunately, Fedora 64-bit has (at this point) not installed a single 32-bit rpm, so they'll be easy to clear out later.

*We've also had complaints about echo* from the other end of a Skype-to-Skype call.  Strangely, the audio sounds fine on the laptop itself.  However, other Skype machines in the same location (same login) don't have the issue (same version of Fedora. etc).


### Extra : Start SSHd

{% highlight bash %}
systemctl start sshd
systemctl enable sshd
{% endhighlight %}


### Extra : Mount shared drive

  *  Added line to ```/etc/fstab```
  *  Added credentials file to ```/home/<username>/.cifs/<servername>```
  *  Added hostname to ```/etc/hosts```
  *  Added mountpoint to ```/mnt/<point>```
  *  Added soft-link in ```/home/<username>/<mountfolder>``` to correct folder within the mounted drive


### Extra : Add IBus-Japanese-KanaKanji





### Misc stuff (exploratory work - not required to make the machine run)

### Getting Suspend to work (nomodeset removal fixes all this)

Works : Get suspend working properly

  * add kernel opt : acpi_osi=Linux
    * Ahah : The modesetting seems to be a major factor (NOW WORKS!)
  
  * Sleeping appears to put the network to sleep appropriately
  * And pressing key brings back 'extra blue light'.
  * And the SSH session is available again - but screen not showing anything
  * Install acpid to see whether that should be playing a role

  
### Works : Screen brightness controls

Needs : ```acpi_osi="Linux"```

Not required : ```acpi_backlight=vendor```
  
  * http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=165133&start=20
  * Have a look in :  /sys/class/backlight/  to see whether there's something there...

{% highlight bash %}
yum install acpid
systemctl enable acpid
systemctl start acpid
acpi_listen 
  # .. works for VolUp and VolDown (and Mute and DisplaySwitcher)
  # .. and now for brightness keys
{% endhighlight %}

NOT REQUIRED : 
{% highlight bash %}
yum install xbacklight
{% endhighlight %}
