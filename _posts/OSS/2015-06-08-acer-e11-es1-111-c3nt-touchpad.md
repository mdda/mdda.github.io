This is a nice little notebook I picked up recently at a Singapore Expo (NB: Prices in Singapore aren't nearly as cheap as the location would suggest : I should have stayed in the USA to get better prices...)

### Basic Specs

  * Intel Celeron CPU N2840 @ 2.16GHz
  * 2Gb RAM
  * 11inch display
  * 320Gb HD
  * Fanless
  
### Problem : Touchpad sometimes goes 'Berserk'

  *  If the touchpad has 'gone away' again : Try the `Fn-F7` is 'touchpad on/off' key
  
  *  Sometimes the touchpad goes 'berzerk', this can sometimes be cured (best method so far) by doing `Fn-F7` twice.
  
    * If anyone has any clues about how to fix this properly, then please leave a comment below

*NOTES:*

From the discussion below, it seems that the 'berzerk' thing may well not be Linux-related at all.  There
are quite a few complaints from Windows users too in the Acer forums, with many returning their
laptops to Acer for a hardware fix.  I didn't notice this initially, since my web searches were
always "Linux Acer touchpad ...", which effectively filtered out the overarching hardware aspect.

... 

Actually, I've just (2015-05-31) dismantled, fiddled around and reassembled the machine, and will post 
shortly about the results - once they're more conclusive (I only know that the machine still works
at this point, and need longer to watch for the intermittent 'berzerk' behaviour).
