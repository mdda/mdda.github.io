here are three approaches to enhancing the sound quality (and some reasonable settings for video).

###  MikuMikuDance - import without MMD/Windows

Current 'live' branch of Blender import code : 
*   https://github.com/powroupi/blender_mmd_tools   # Branch : dev_test !
*   https://github.com/powroupi/blender_mmd_tools/wiki/Documentation

And updater script to make the models more 'blendery' :
