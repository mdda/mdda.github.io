## Watch for the Compute Capability

Up until now, my graphics cards have all worked fine with TensorFlow and PyTorch.  And clearly they 
are still supported by Nvidia's ```cuda``` drivers.

However, much to my surprise, suddenly ```TensorFlow``` and ```PyTorch``` have effectively EOL-ed
one of my cards : Which caused me to look at [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus](Nvidia's Compute Capability) listings.

This post highlights cards that are now 'out', those on the verge of 'falling out', and 
those that should be Ok for a bit...
